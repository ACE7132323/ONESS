## How to use it

In order to use SeeForex you need to install Harmony One Wallet extension for Brave, Chrome and Firefox, unfortunately Safari and Edge extensions are not ready yet. So go get the wallet at the Chrome Store and install it in your browser of choice.

Now you can use SeeForex at its fullest and you'll quickly learn how easy it is to interact with the DApp since it has been designed to be a one-click trading experience. Just select the currency you'd like to buy or sell then enter the amount in the form, the price will reflect the current rate at which you'll trade your currency, then click 'TRADE'. Your Harmony Wallet will pop up asking to confirm a transaction and you should click 'Approve' in order to perform a trade. That's it, you will get fiat tokens in your wallet as you can confirm in your new balance.

Once you get your currencies you can send them to any person or business that takes fiat currencies as these tokens are backed by every single ONE traded for them. If you decide to sell your currencies then do the opposite transaction, sell your fiat and get ONE at market price. We collect 1% fee on every transaction for site maintenance and hosting costs.

**That's how easy it is to trade currencies in SeeForex!**
